                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                phpMyFAQ 2.8.12 is containing a SQL Injection vulnerability through the restore
                                function. This functionality is only executable by admin users with special permissions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The application containing cross site scripting and content spoofing vulnerabilities
                                through Flash files bundled with TinyMCE and Ajax FileManager plugins.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The bundled TinyMCE Editor (v3.5.11) containing a DOM based stored cross site scripting
                                vulnerability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The "delete user" functionality of phpMyFAQ 2.8.12 is containing a CSRF vulnerability.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An attacker can delete any open question through another CSRF vulnerability because of
                                the lack of a CSRF token.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The check on "download an attachment" permissions is not working correct, so that anyone
                                can download attachments.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An admin having privilege to delete any FAQ multi-site primary instance.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The application containing an improper Captcha implementation, as a result an attacker
                                can replay the request to bypass the Captcha protections on forms.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Administrator is able to view information about specific user session with unfiltered
                                IPs and user agents.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Solution</h2>
