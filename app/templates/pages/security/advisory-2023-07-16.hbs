<p>
  The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of multiple security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 3.1.13 and
  earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site scripting (XSS) and CSV injection vulnerabilities.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  phpMyFAQ doesn't implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS when intercepting malicious content into FAQs. Additionally
  phpMyFAQ doesn't implement sufficient checks against CSV injections.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
  The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 3.1.16, which fixes these vulnerabilities. All
  users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>
  There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 3.1.16.
</p>
