  earlier. An authentication bypass has been discovered in the phpMyFAQ application.
  This vulnerability allows attackers to take over accounts that do not have Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) configured.

  It was found that the 2FA implementation has a critical flaw.
  Specifically, the "secret" field for 2FA can be left as a blank string under some conditions, including fresh installations.
  The vulnerability exists in the handling of the 2FA token in the `index.php` and `TwoFactor.php` files.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>

  The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 4.0.0-alpha.3, which fixes the vulnerability. All
  users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
</p>

<p>
  There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 3.2.8 or phpMyFAQ 4.0.0-alpha.3.
</p>
