<p>
  The phpMyFAQ Team has learned of multiple security issues that'd been discovered in phpMyFAQ 3.2.4 and
  earlier. phpMyFAQ contains cross-site scripting (XSS), phishing and spoofing vulnerabilities.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  phpMyFAQ doesn't implement sufficient checks to avoid XSS when storing on attachments filenames.
  The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send arbitrary
  emails to a large range of targets.
  phpMyFAQ's user removal page allows an attacker to spoof another user's detail, and in turn make a compelling phishing
  case for removing another user's account.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>
  The phpMyFAQ Team has released the new phpMyFAQ version 3.2.5, which fixes these vulnerabilities. All
  users of affected phpMyFAQ versions are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible to this latest version.
</p>

<h2>Workaround</h2>
<p>
  There's no workaround except installing phpMyFAQ 3.2.5.
</p>
