            <strong>Selecting a Hosting Company:</strong> The options appearing on this page are selected based
            on their exceptional security, performance, support-quality and other desirable characteristics.
            While we approach this matter with the utmost diligence, please understand that phpMyFAQ is unable
            to supply any warranty or guarantee your personal experience. phpMyFAQ participates in the
            commission-based affiliate programs offered by most hosting companies and receives financial
            compensation for referrals, all of which is applied toward the regular operation of the community
            oriented project. In the unlikely event that you encounter any unresolvable complications with any
            of these organisations, please notify us.
