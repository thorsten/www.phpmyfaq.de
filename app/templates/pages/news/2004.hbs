  1.4.x we released the security updates, <a href="/download">phpMyFAQ 1.3.13</a>
  and <a href="/download">phpMyFAQ 1.4.0 alpha2</a>. Everyone running affected
  versions of phpMyFAQ is encouraged to upgrade immediately. The new 1.3.13 release doesn't include other
  changes, so upgrading from 1.3.12 is safe. phpMyFAQ 1.4.0 alpha2 includes some unready new features
