                record in various categories, the template engine can parse PHP code if you like, we have complete
                XML, XHTML and DocBook XML exports and a completely rewritten PDF export. Beside a better RSS support
                we've made a general code cleanup. Do not use this version in production systems, but test this version

                In response to vulnerabilities in the stable branch phpMyFAQ 1.3.x and the development version phpMyFAQ

                versions of phpMyFAQ is encouraged to upgrade immediately. The new 1.3.13 release doesn't include other
                changes, so upgrading from 1.3.12 is safe. phpMyFAQ 1.4.0 alpha2 includes some unready new features
                like a better integration of the WYSIWYG editor, a better PDF export and dozens of bug fixes. A
