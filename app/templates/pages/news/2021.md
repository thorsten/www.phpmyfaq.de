The phpMyFAQ team is quietly celebrating the project's 20th birthday today - in memory of the over 2 million CoVID-19
deaths already worldwide. It's been a wild ride from PHP3 and MySQL 3.22 in the early days to PHP8 and multiple database
support today. Thanks for the great 20 years to all users, contributors and friends of the project.
Thank you!
