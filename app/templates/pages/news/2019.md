The phpMyFAQ Team would like to announce the availability of [phpMyFAQ 3.0.0-alpha.4](/download), the "Joachim Deckarm"
release. The forth pre-release adds a 404 page template and improves the brute force detection handling. We updated
the Turkish translation and updated all third party dependencies. We fixed a lot of issue found by our test users of the
second alpha release and we updated almost all of our bundled dependencies. Please don't use this version in production
systems, but test this version and please report bugs!
