The phpMyFAQ Team is pleased to announce [phpMyFAQ 3.2.0-alpha](/download), the "Lance Reddick" release. With the first
preview release we changed the PHP requirement to PHP 8.1.0 or later and introduced HTTPS as the new default. If you use
MariaDB, MySQL, Percona Server or Galera Cluster, phpMyFAQ now only supports InnoDB. We added support for PHP 8.2, 2FA
(Two Factor Authentication) support, an experimental Azure AD login, the option to use Google ReCaptcha, our own new
REST API v2.2 to fetch groups and add categories, a verification of backup files, an option to disable questions and
notifications and a new mobile first, touch-friendly default layout. We removed the experimental large permissions
support with sections, we migrated from SwiftMailer to Symfony Mailer and we also refactored our codebase to use PHP 8.1
language features. Additionally we updated to Bootstrap v5.3 and bundled TinyMCE v6.3. Please don't use this version in
production systems, but test this version and please report bugs!
