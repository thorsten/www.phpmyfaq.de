(Two Factor Authentication) support, an experimental Azure AD login, the option to use Google ReCaptcha, our own new
REST API v2.2 to fetch groups and add categories, a verification of backup files, an option to disable questions and
notifications and a new mobile first, touch-friendly default layout. We removed the experimental large permissions
support with sections, we migrated from SwiftMailer to Symfony Mailer and we also refactored our codebase to use PHP 8.1
language features. Additionally, we updated to Bootstrap v5.3 and bundled TinyMCE v6.3. Please don't use this version in
production systems, but test this version and please report bugs!
